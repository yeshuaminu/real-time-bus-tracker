# Real Time Bus Tracker
Track the bus stops between MIT and Harvard with this interactive animation of the Massachusetts area. The marker on the map indicates all of the bus stops on the shortest route between these two campuses.
## How to Run

## Roadmap of future improvements
Next steps for future rollouts include adding a bubble over the marker to indicate both the bus line and the time the bus should arrive at each stop.
